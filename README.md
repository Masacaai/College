# College

A collection of all the projects I did in college:

## CS-141 Programming Design II:
- DivvyData: Quantify and summarize Divvy Bike data and analyze patterns and similarities between a weekday (September 1st) and a weekend (September 4th).
- Gladiolus: Prompt for the number of sections and display an ASCII gladiolus flower, with the sections centered above each other.
- Great13: Create a peg puzzle game where you jump pegs to try and leave only a single peg remaining.
- Typing: Create a typing tutor program that prompts for words to type, keeping track whether you spell them correctly, within a time limit.
- Unscrambler: Create a board that is filled with words which are then scrambled and presented to the user, who rotates the rows and columns to try and get the original words displayed in the right order on the board.
- UnscramblerUndo: Add the option to undo a move to the Unscrambler game using linked lists.

## CS-211 Programming Practicum:
- Project 1: Create a 'search' game where the player moves in the 4 cardinal directions with constant feedback until they reach the destination.
- Project 2: Create functions for a program that demonstrates the concept of heap allocation of arrays in C.
- Project 3: Create a balloon-pop game where you strategically pop balloons to create clusters of the same color to achieve higher scores. Analogous to Candy Crush.
- Project 4: Create functions for a program that demonstrates the concept of linked lists in C.
- Project 5: Create a service queue program that takes in new customer requests and assigns buzzers to them. Analogous to the reservation/seating system in a fine-dining restaurant.

## CS-251 Data Structures:
- DNA Profiling: An app that is able to build DNA strands using the provided ourvector implementation and then determine who the DNA matches to in a database. 
- Personality Tests: A program that is able to generate a personality quiz based on the five-factor model and match the player to a fictional character based on their answers.
- Bar Chart: This application uses BarChartAnimate (which uses BarChart, which uses Bar) to produce an animated bar chart in the terminal.
- Labyrinth Escape: A fun little game that teaches the use of gdb where you use gdb to naviagate a maze and find items.
- MyMap: A re-implementation of a map in C++ using a self-balancing threaded binary search tree.
- File Compression: An implementation of Huffman file compression.
- OpenStreetMaps: A program that uses openstreetmaps data to calculate the distance between two people and the route to be taken by them to meet at a common point.

## CS 398 Provably Correct Programming:
Proved the MU Puzzle from GEB using the Coq proof assistant.

## Python Code Jam 2022:
Created a Restaurant manager program to handle staff check-ins and match customer orders with staff specialities.
