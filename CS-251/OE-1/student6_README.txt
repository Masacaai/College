DISCLAIMER: This live coding prompt is purposely ambiguous.  We arenâ€™t going to tell you exactly how to cout, exactly how to handle edge cases, etc.  There is no autograder and auto grading would defeat the purpose of the exercise.  Instead, you should talk through all of your thoughts and state any assumptions as you are solving the problem.  

You got this.  :D  

PROMPT:

**********************
About - The file contains a list of price of stocks.  The first text in the file is a string header.  
Each remaining text item is a numeric double type representing a stock's price. 

File reading - read the data in. Store header in a string variable and rest of the data into two vectors.

Process/Calculations - Calculate the mean stock price of all companies listed.
Then, print the companies and the price of the stocks that are above the mean. If you finish that, now try to print companies in alphabetical order without calling a sorting function (but you can use new containers).   

Creative component (if time permits) - create one cin and one cout for this problem.  
Make sure your code uses the cin.  

****************
Good luck!
