Did you know?

In the popular game 'Elden Ring', characters in the game repeatedly call out the protagonist for being 'maidenless'.
This is actually a reference to the fact that most players playing a FromSoft game are maidenless in real life.

If you didn't find that funny, I'm sorry. I thought it was. 
Well, I hope you're having a good day, and I hope I get good points on this project.
This class is actually pretty fun, albeit fairly work-intensive.
That's all I have to say. I hope this message is enough effort lol.
