## CS-211 Programming Practicum:
- Project 1: Create a 'search' game where the player moves in the 4 cardinal directions with constant feedback until they reach the destination.
- Project 2: Create functions for a program that demonstrates the concept of heap allocation of arrays in C.
- Project 3: Create a balloon-pop game where you strategically pop balloons to create clusters of the same color to achieve higher scores. Analogous to Candy Crush.
- Project 4: Create functions for a program that demonstrates the concept of linked lists in C.
- Project 5: Create a service queue program that takes in new customer requests and assigns buzzers to them. Analogous to the reservation/seating system in a fine-dining restaurant.
