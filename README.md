# College

A collection of all the projects I did in college:

## CS-141 Programming Design II:
- DivvyData: Quantify and summarize Divvy Bike data and analyze patterns and similarities between a weekday (September 1st) and a weekend (September 4th).
- Gladiolus: Prompt for the number of sections and display an ASCII gladiolus flower, with the sections centered above each other.
- Great13: Create a peg puzzle game where you jump pegs to try and leave only a single peg remaining.
- Typing: Create a typing tutor program that prompts for words to type, keeping track whether you spell them correctly, within a time limit.

- UnscramblerUndo: Add the option to undo a move to the Unscrambler game using linked lists.

## CS-211 Programming Practicum:
- Project 1: Create a 'search' game where the player moves in the 4 cardinal directions with constant feedback until they reach the destination.
